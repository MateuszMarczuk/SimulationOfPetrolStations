# SimulationOfPetrolStations

Simulate the operation of a gas station. 
The station has a certain number of positions with the distributors of various types of gasoline, LPG or ON.
Cars choose the type of fuel with a given probability distribution and select a vacant position or waiting in the queue, they are all busy.
Number of seats in front of stations is limited. 
Refueling time is random (a predetermined probability distribution) and depends on the type of fuel.
After refueling, drivers get to a cash (with cable), and after paying exempt position.
He also works car wash, to which customers can enter the vehicle after refueling.
The draw customers to the car wash according to the set schedule.
Customers pay for the cleaning in the same hand as for refueling, but only after the service.
Estimate the following characteristics:
- Expected limit the number of cars in the queue for distributors and car wash
- The expected time limit refueling the car (from the entrance to the station to leave the refueling station)
- The expected time limit car washing (from leaving the refueling station to leave the car wash)
- Limit the probability of resignation from service by the driver of the car.
